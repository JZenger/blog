Hey! I'm a computer science student at the University of Waterloo going into my third year of study. This summer, I'm interning at Kik Interactive working on their chat bot platform. I am an avid tennis player and rock climber and love following basketball (although ball is definetly not life). I'm going to try and document bits of my life here so stay tuned :)
