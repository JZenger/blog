Hey! I'm a computer science student at the University of Waterloo going into my third year of study. This summer, I'm interning at <a href="https://www.kik.com/">Kik Interactive</a>, working on their chat bot platform. I am an avid tennis player and rock climber and love following basketball (although ball is definitely not life). I'm going to try and document bits of my life here so stay tuned :)
