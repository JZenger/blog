title: Yelp Internship
---

This past winter term, I interned at <a href="https://www.yelp.com/">Yelp</a> on the transactions team. The project that I was tasked with was to create a native post-order experience on the Yelp app. To complete the project, I needed to create an endpoint for Yelp's partners to post their order status updates to and design a table to store the updates. Upon receiving the updates from the partners, we would process the data and send push notifications to users to notify them about updates to their order. The final piece to complete the native post-order experience was to create an API that clients would hit to be able to render an order status page. Together all these pieces resulted in the following product:

The internship was an amazing experience and it's cool to think that thousands of people are using my feature everyday. I got to plan and implement this feature with near full autonomy, and along the way I learned a bunch about what it takes to completely ship a product. This was also my first dive into backend web developement and a service oriented architecture, so there were lots of cool tech challenges to solve everyday. I'm excited to take these experiences and apply them to future projects :)
